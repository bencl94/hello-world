# hello-world
This is my initial repository to try github

Hi,
My name is Benjamin. I'm born in 7th Septemeber 1994. I live in Leipzig Germany.
I studied Computer Science and started this github account to build a portfolio, try new programming languages and keep improving as a software developer.

That's it.
